## General Information
Bézier curves represent smooth curves commonly used in graphic design, animation, and manufacturing. These curves are formed by connecting multiple control points that dictate the curve's shape and trajectory. Exploring the construction of Bézier curves provides insight into the algorithm utilized for curve generation, specifically the Midpoint Algorithm. This algorithm employs both the Divide and Conquer method and the Brute Force method to construct Bézier curves. The Divide and Conquer approach divides the problem into smaller subproblems, solves them individually, and then merges the solutions to resolve the original problem. Conversely, the Brute Force method solves the problem by exhaustively testing all possible solutions and selecting the most optimal one.
